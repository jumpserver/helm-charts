# Unleash Kubernetes Helm Chart

[![Release Charts](https://github.com/jumpserver/helm-charts/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jumpserver/helm-charts/actions/workflows/release.yml)

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:
